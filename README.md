# FTP-RC
This is a proof-of-concept demonstrated at a hackathon held at Bellevue College on December 3rd, 2016. It shows how a FTP server can be used to remotely control a PC. This is done by running a program on a PC that continually checks the FTP server, at regular interavals, for a file with a command in it. Original concept by Noah Allen.
