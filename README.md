# FTP-RC
This is a proof-of-concept demonstrated at a hackathon held at Bellevue College on December 3rd, 2016. It shows how a FTP server can be used to remotely control a PC. This is done by running a program on a PC that continually checks the FTP server, at regular intervals, for a file with a command in it. The example code includes an encryption class, however it is not utilized in order to clearify the core concept. The code has the client check into a FTP server at 127.0.0.1 (user:root, password: password) and checks for a file named clients.txt. If the client’s MAC address (unique identifier) is not in this file then it is added. Next, the client checks back to the server, every second, for a file named (Client MAC)CMD.txt. If this file contains a “0”: the client uploads a screenshot. Original concept by Noah Allen.
